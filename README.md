# Why? 

Playing a character and I wanted to use touch spells to Paralyze enemies instead of the ones that already are present in Mysticism. Releasing as a mod 'cause I figure some other people might enjoy it. Literally first ever SSE and Magic mod, feel free to yell at me for everything I did wrong/bad, or suggest different values for things. (One thing I was thinking was maybe longer Paralysis duration to "reward" getting close enough to paralyze the target).
